## WebGL

The main outcome of this project is to easily add 3D content to various applications. I studied the fundamental concepts of 3D computer graphics independent of rendering approach and graphics API, and then applied the knowledge both through a higher-level API and a low-level API.

## Tech Stack

Interactive computer graphics. Display data structures and procedures. Graphics pipeline. Geometric transformations. Viewing in three dimensions. Illumination and color models. Object modelling in 2D and 3D.

## Projections

I have designed and completes three projects using WebGL. Various mapping strategies are involved: bump mapping, displacement mapping, environment mapping, and shadow mapping. In terms of chromaticity and luminance, you can change RGB Colours to have different manipulations. Bezier curves, splines, and ray tracing are also implemented.
